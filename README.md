# Link Unfurling

## Introduction
This is an Link Unfurling app that can unfurl an adaptive card after user pastes a link. This app also enables Zero Install Link Unfurling which helps you unfurl a card for your links even before you discovered or installed your app in Teams.

- From TeamsFx CLI: 
  - Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and start your local tunnel service by running the command `ngrok http 3978`.
  - In the `env/.env.local` file, fill in the values for `BOT_DOMAIN` and `BOT_ENDPOINT` with your ngrok URL.
    ```
    BOT_DOMAIN=sample-id.ngrok.io
    BOT_ENDPOINT=http://sample-id.ngrok.io
    ```
  - Executing the command `teamsfx provision --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsfx deploy --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsfx preview --env local` in your project directory.

## How to add link unfurling cache in Teams
This template removes cache by default to provide convenience for debug. To add cache, remove following JSON part from adaptive card:
```ts
suggestedActions: {
          actions: [
            {
              title: "default",
              type: "setCachePolicy",
              value: '{"type":"no-cache"}',
            },
          ],
        }
```
After removing this, the link unfurling result will be cached in Teams for 30 minutes.
