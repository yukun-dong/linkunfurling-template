# Link Unfurling

## Introduction
This is an Link Unfurling app that can unfurl an adaptive card after user pastes a link. This app also enables Zero Install Link Unfurling which helps you unfurl a card for your links even before you discovered or installed your app in Teams.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- A Microsoft 365 account. If you do not have Microsoft 365 account, apply one from [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug
- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5`.
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button. You can choose to debug in Teams or Outlook depending on your preference.
- From TeamsFx CLI: 
  - Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and start your local tunnel service by running the command `ngrok http 3978`.
  - In the `env/.env.local` file, fill in the values for `BOT_DOMAIN` and `BOT_ENDPOINT` with your ngrok URL.
    ```
    BOT_DOMAIN=sample-id.ngrok.io
    BOT_ENDPOINT=http://sample-id.ngrok.io
    ```
  - Executing the command `teamsfx provision --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsfx deploy --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsfx preview --env local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:
* `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Preview

Once the provisioning and deployment steps are finished, you can preview your app:

- From Visual Studio Code

  1. Open the `Run and Debug Activity Panel`.
  1. Select `Launch Remote in Teams` or `Launch Remote in Outlook` from the launch configuration drop-down.
  1. Press the Play (green arrow) button to launch your app - now running remotely from Azure.

- From TeamsFx CLI: execute `teamsfx preview --env dev` in your project directory to launch your application.
## How to add link unfurling cache in Teams
This template removes cache by default to provide convenience for debug. To add cache, remove following JSON part from adaptive card:
```ts
suggestedActions: {
          actions: [
            {
              title: "default",
              type: "setCachePolicy",
              value: '{"type":"no-cache"}',
            },
          ],
        }
```
After removing this, the link unfurling result will be cached in Teams for 30 minutes. Please refer to [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/link-unfurling?tabs=desktop%2Cjson%2Cadvantages#remove-link-unfurling-cache) for more details.
